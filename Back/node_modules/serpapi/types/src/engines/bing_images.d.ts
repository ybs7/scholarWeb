     * delivers results. The market must be in the form <language code>-<country code>.

     * Codes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-custom-search-api-v7-reference#market-codes).
     * NOTE: If known, you are encouraged to always specify the market. Specifying the
     * market helps Bing route the request and return an appropriate and optimal
     * response. If you specify a market that is not listed in [Market
     * Codes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-custom-search-api-v7-reference#market-codes),
     * Bing Images API uses a best fit market code based on an internal mapping that is
     * subject to change.
     * This parameter and the cc query parameter are mutually exclusiveâ€”do not specify
     * both.
